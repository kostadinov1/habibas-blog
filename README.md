Hi. This is a Blog page I am doing for a friend. 
It consists of Blog Page, Gallery, Owner's Articles, and it has users which can make comments and like each comment when authorized.
Frontend template was pre-made, but I did modify it quite a bit. It is dockerized and hosted at aws ec2. I used Docker-compose and Nginx.
The project can be found at: http://ec2-13-40-83-199.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ (the link might change due to changes in the instance). There is no domain name yet. This is the reason why 
the connection is not encrypted(https). If it gets to be used it will get the latter. P.S. My frontend skills are to be improved...
